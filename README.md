# Project_Challenge_Day03

⏱️ Pomodoro Timer App – Day 3 of 30 Days Coding Challenge

This project is part of my 30-Day Coding Challenge, where I build one project every day to improve my development skills.

🌟 About the Project

On Day 3, I created a Pomodoro Timer App 🍅 built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The app includes:

25-minute work sessions

5-minute break cycles

Start, Pause, and Reset functionality

A clean, responsive dark theme UI

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of JavaScript timers, DOM manipulation, and interactive UI design.

👥 Collaboration

This challenge is something I’m doing together with my coding partner Swara.
We’re pushing each other to stay consistent and keep improving our skills day by day 🚀.

📅 Challenge

This is Day 3 of 30 in the challenge. Excited to keep building and sharing my progress!
